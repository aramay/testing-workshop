// you're going to need to start the server before all the tests
// start and close the server after all the tests are finished.
// startServer is a function that returns a promise which resolves
// to the server object. The server object has a `close` function
// which accepts a callback. Kinda wonky, I know... But you should
// learn how to use both async styles with these tests so I left it
// like that :)

// I'm going to give you this just so you don't have to look it up:
const api = axios.create({
  baseURL: 'http://localhost:3000/api',
})
// Note also that the articles endpoints are at: api/articles
// So to get articles, you can do: api.get('articles') which
// will return a promise that resolves to the response from the
// request.
//
// From here you're pretty much on your own.
// To come up with what to test, try to think of
// the use cases you want to support. Start with
// the unauthenticated stuff.
//
// If you want to do authenticated endpoints,
// you'll need to call createNewUser, and use the
// token you get back like this:
// api.defaults.headers.common.authorization = `Token ${token}`
// then the api is authenticated

// just a handy utility for some of our promise-based code
// you might consider making something similar for the articles
// stuff
const getUser = res => res.data.user
