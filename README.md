üëã hi there! My name is [Kent C. Dodds](https://kentcdodds.com)! This is a workshop repo to teach you about testing
JavaScript applications.

## Thank You

Big thanks to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) project from
[GoThinkster](https://github.com/gothinkster). This project is a copy of
[the Node implementation](https://github.com/gothinkster/node-express-realworld-example-app) and
[the React implementation](https://github.com/GoThinkster/react-redux-realworld-example-app) of the RealWorld project.

Also thank you to all the [contributors](#contributors)

## Topics covered

1. Unit Testing with [Jest](http://facebook.github.io/jest)
2. Integration Testing with [Jest](http://facebook.github.io/jest)
3. End to End (E2E) Testing with [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/)

We'll mention other forms of testing, but these are the types we'll focus on and learn in this workshop. We'll learn
about the benefits (and tradeoffs) of [TDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development). We'll learn how to
configure the tools and why, when, where, and what to test.

## Project

### System Requirements

- [git][git] v2.10.2 or greater
- [NodeJS][node] v6.9.5 or greater
- [yarn][yarn] v0.20.3 or greater (or [npm][npm] v4.2.0 or greater)
- [MongoDB][mongo] v3.4.2 or greater

All of these must be available in your `PATH`. To verify things are set up properly, you can run this:

```
git --version
node --version
yarn --version
mongod --version
```

If you have trouble with any of these, learn more about the PATH environment variable and how to fix it here for
[windows][win-path] or [mac/linux][mac-path].

### Setup

After you've made sure to have the correct things (and versions) installed, you should be able to just run a few
commands to get set up:

```
git clone https://github.com/kentcdodds/testing-workshop.git
cd testing-workshop
npm run setup --silent
node ./scripts/autofill-feedback-email.js YOUR@EMAIL.com
git commit -am "ready to go"
```

> Change `YOUR@EMAIL.com` to your actual email address

This may take a few minutes. If you get any errors, run `git reset origin/master --hard` to make sure
you have a clean project again,
then please read the error output and see whether there's any
instructions to fix things and try again. If you're still getting errors or need any help at all, then please
[file an issue][issue].

**Note:** You might see this:

<img src="other/cypress-network.png" alt="Cypress Network issue" title="Cypress Network issue" width="400" />

I'm not sure how to prevent this from happening (suggestions appreciated!) but it happens every time you run the `e2e`
tests. Just do nothing or hit `Allow` to make it go away (super annoying). Sorry about that üòû

#### Cypress

> If you're a windows user, please see the next section...

For everyone else, you'll want to come with Cypress.io downloaded, installed and have an account ready to go.
Please follow [these instructions](https://docs.cypress.io/docs/installing-and-running) to do this!

##### Windows users!!

Unfortunately, the [cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) application does not yet support the Windows platform.
(Bug them about it [here](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/74)).
You should still be able to run cypress in "headless" mode, but you will be unable to open the application
for development.

To get around this issue, you'll have to run the E2E portion of the workshop on Linux or Mac. I recommend either
installing and booting your machine in Linux, or running a Linux Virtual Machine on your Windows computer.

Alternatively, you could just forego the application bit and mostly observe that portion of the workshop. If you're
doing this with a group, perhaps you could pair with someone who has a Mac or Linux machine.

### Running the app

To get the app up and running (and really see if it worked), run:

```shell
npm start dev

# if using yarn
yarn start dev
```


This _should_ start `mongod`, the `api` server, and the `client` server all at
the same time. Your browser should open up automatically to
`http://localhost:8080` (if it doesn't, just open that yourself) and you should
be able to start messing around with the app.

Here's what you should be looking at:

<img src="other/conduit-screenshot.png" alt="Conduit Screenshot" title="Conduit Screenshot" width="700" />

If this fails at any point for you, please first see
[Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) and if you still can't get it working,
[make an issue][issue].

#### Login

If you want to login, there's a user you can use:

- **Email**: `joe@example.com`
- **Password**: `joe`

**To stop all the servers**, hit <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd>.

> Protip: we're using [`nps`](https://github.com/kentcdodds/nps) in this
> project. If you want to type less, then you can install `nps` globally:
> `yarn global add nps` (or `npm i -g nps`) and then you can run `nps`
> instead of `npm start`

### Troubleshooting

#### `npm start dev` command not working

If it doesn't work for you, you can start each of these individually yourself:

```
npm start dev.mongo
```

```
npm start dev.api
```

```
npm start dev.client
```

#### `verify.js` saying something's wrong with mongo

The `mongod` binary needs to be available in your path for you to run `mongod` from the command line (which is what this
project's scripts does for you). Learn how to do this [on windows][win-path] or [on mac][mac-path].

> Note: you'll need to open a new terminal/command prompt window after you've done this.

### Structure

This project has a bit of a unique setup. Normally you'll have just a single `package.json` at the root of your
repository, but to simplify setup I've included both the `api` and `client` projects in a single repository. The root
of the project has a `package.json` as does `api`, and `client`. Most of our time working on tooling and running tests
will be in one of these sub-directories (with the exception of the E2E tests).
